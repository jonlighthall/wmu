# WMU Thesis Template

## Background
When I wrote my dissertation at Western Michigan University, the only thesis template available was written for Microsoft Word.
I developed my own template, written in LaTeX, which conformed to the Graduate College Guidelines.
The contents of this repository are the result of those efforts.
After graduating, I offered this template to the Graduate College, but they never made it available; that is why I created this repository.

## Contents
This repository contains the following LaTeX files

|    | file                                   | type | purpose                           | 
| -- | -------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------  | 
|  1 | [`readme.tex`](readme.tex)             | document | Instructions for using the template |
|  2 | [`wmu-template.tex`](wmu-template.tex) | document  | Minimum working example |
|  3 | [`wmu-thesis.cls`](wmu-thesis.cls)     | document class | WMU formatting template | 

## Further Example
A more thorough example utilizing this template, my complete dissertation, is available at https://github.com/jonlighthall/thesis.
